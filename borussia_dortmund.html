<h1>Borussia Dortmund Football Club</h1>
<h3>The History</h3> </hgroup>
<p>
Dortmund was founded in 1909, by a group of eighteen youths unhappy with the local chaplain's treatment of their church-sponsored football team. Being a relatively small club, Dortmund's ambitions were moderate to start with.
</p>
<p>
The club barely avoided bankruptcy in 1929, and being an anti-Nazi oriented club during the Third Reich regime certainly didn't help matters. Their first taste of silverware came in the mid-50s, with two consecutive national titles in 1956 and 1957.
</p>
<p>
Having proved themselves by winning the last German national championship ever held (1963), Dortmund were among the sixteen clubs invited to play in the newly-formed Bundesliga. In general, the 60s were a fruitful period for the club, which claimed its first DFB-Pokal in 1965 and its first and only Cup Winners' Cup the following year. This would be their last trophy for a while, as the next three decades were fraught with continual financial troubles.
</p>
<p>
<h3>The Ottmar Hitzfeld era</h3>
</p>
<p>
Even with the club winning its second DFB-Pokal in 1989, the future wasn't looking too bright. Their fortunes would finally change with the hiring of Ottmar Hitzfeld in 1992; with the genius strategist in charge, Dortmund soared to the top of German football. After winning two consecutive Bundesliga titles in 1995 and 1996, Dortmund set off to conquer the rest of Europe.
</p>
<p>
In 1997, they advanced to the Champions League finals, where they handily defeated the favored Juventus 3-1.
